# **Michelangelo Buonarroti, _'Il Divino'_**

**Michelangelo Buonarroti** (March 6, 1475 - February 18, 1564) is considered the most famous artist of the Italian Renaissance. Some even think it is safe to say that he is the greatest artist to have ever lived, "exerting an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art".
Already the Italian Renaissance Michelangelo Buonarroti was seen as the protagonist of his time, enjoying a celebrity status.
His artwork was referenced countless times, to the extent that in the present day and age most people are familiar with his oeuvre, sometimes without even knowing the artist's actual name.

So Michelangelo's artwork has become part of our Western _'icons'_, our _'cultural subconscience'_, but who was the man behind all these works? 
And did this _'divine'_ Michelangelo like his own art as much as we do?

Have a look at the rest of this website to find out!


# _Sonetto 5_ and the Sistine Chapel


Italian original | English translation
------------ | -------------
I’ ho già fatto un gozzo in questo stento, | I really got a goitre on this job,
coma fa l’acqua a’ gatti in Lombardia | like water does to cats in Lombardy
o ver d’altro paese che si sia, |  or in whatever other place may be,
c’a forza ’l ventre appicca sotto ’l mento. | which forced my gut to stick atop my gob.
  La barba al cielo, e la memoria sento | Beard to sky and nape, where memory’s sent,
in sullo scrigno, e ’l petto fo d’arpia, | laid back upon its coffin, Harpy-like the breast,
e ’l pennel sopra ’l viso tuttavia | and anyway the brush above is best,
mel fa, gocciando, un ricco pavimento. | which, playing, makes the face a rich pavement.
  E’ lombi entrati mi son nella peccia, | And my loins slip to my stomach, deep inside,
e fo del cul per contrapeso groppa, |  and for counterweight, my back gets my behind;
e ’ passi senza gli occhi muovo invano. | and in vain I’d move the eyes along their arc.
  Dinanzi mi s’allunga la corteccia, | In front of me I have my tight-stretched hide
e per piegarsi adietro si ragroppa, | and, folding, it’s all puckered-up behind.
e tendomi com’arco sorïano. | and I extend myself, a Syrian arch.
Però fallace e strano | How fallacious and arch
surge il iudizio che la mente porta, | the judgement grows, for which my mind is porter:
ché mal si tra’ per cerbottana torta. | a crooked blow-pipe serves but as distorter.
La mia pittura morta |  My lifeless picture
difendi orma’, Giovanni, e ’l mio onore, | now defend, Giovanni, and my honor,
non sendo in loco bon, né io pittore. | I’ll land in no good place, and I’m no painter.
